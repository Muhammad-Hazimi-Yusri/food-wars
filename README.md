- **Stock used vs. purchased display** — ProductDetailModal "Total stock" row shows `current/original` format (e.g. `270/300 g`) when stock has been partially consumed, giving instant visibility into usage
- **Purchase Unit Price in History** — Product History tab shows price per purchase unit by default (e.g. "£1.10/pack"), with a pill toggle to switch to per stock unit view; only shown when a QU conversion is defined; price history chart moved below the purchase log table and made collapsible

## Why Food Wars?

> **Acknowledgment:** This project adapts [Grocy's](https://grocy.info) database schema and feature set. Grocy is the gold standard for self-hosted household management — Food Wars is my learning project to understand its architecture while building something accessible for less technical users.

### Background

Grocy is excellent but requires technical setup:
- Self-hosted PHP/SQLite server
- Docker knowledge for easy deployment  
- [grocy-desktop](https://github.com/grocy/grocy-desktop) exists but still needs a webserver for mobile sync

Food Wars targets a different audience: people who want Grocy-like features without managing infrastructure.

### Comparison

| | Grocy | Mealie | Tandoor | **Food Wars** |
|--|-------|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Focus** | Full household ERP | Recipe management | Recipe management | Pantry + waste reduction |
| **Hosting** | Self-host (PHP/SQLite) | Self-host (Python) | Self-host (Django) | Hosted or self-host |
| **Setup** | Docker required | Docker required | Docker required | Sign in (hosted) or Vercel + Supabase (self-host) |
| **Maturity** | Battle-tested since 2017 | Established | Established | Early development |
| **Barcode scanning** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ v0.8 (camera + OFF lookup) |
| **Nutrition facts** | ❌ | ✅ (recipe-level) | ✅ (recipe-level) | ✅ v0.9 (per-product, OFF auto-fill, Nutri-Score) |
| **AI input** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ v0.10 (Ollama NLP stock entry, receipt/pantry scan) + v0.11 (recipe-aware chat) |
| **Offline support** | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ❌ Online only |
| **Multi-user** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🔜 Planned |
| **Chores/Tasks** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ Not planned |
| **Mobile app** | PWA requiring webserver | Via webserver | Via webserver | Responsive web (PWA) via Vercel hosting |

### Our Niche

- **For less technical users** — No homelab, Docker, or server management required
- **Mobile-first** — Responsive design as primary target (you're in the kitchen, not at a desk)
- **Hosted option** — Just sign in at [food-wars.muhammadhazimiyusri.uk](https://food-wars.muhammadhazimiyusri.uk)
- **Self-host option** — Fork and deploy to Vercel + Supabase free tiers (see [Self-Hosting](#self-hosting))
- **Learning in public** — Built with Claude AI to learn from Grocy's architecture

### Privacy Notice

**Hosted version:** Your data is stored in the developer's Supabase database. While secured with Row Level Security (you can only access your own household's data), if you prefer full data ownership, please use the self-hosting option. Access to the hosted version is currently restricted to a single account — other visitors can use guest mode (shared demo data) or self-host for full access.

**Self-hosted:** Your data stays in your own Supabase project. See [Self-Hosting](#self-hosting) for setup instructions.

**AI features (Ollama):** If you connect an Ollama instance on the hosted version, your Ollama URL is stored in our database and AI requests are proxied through our server. For full privacy, self-host Food Wars.

<details>
<summary><strong>v0.13 - Product Analytics ✓</strong></summary>

**Goal:** Rich insights per product

**Product detail modal (v0.13.0):**
- [x] Stock amount (total + per location)
- [x] Stock value (amount × last price)
- [x] Amount opened
- [x] Default location display

**Purchase history (v0.13.1):**
- [x] Last purchased date
- [x] Last price paid
- [x] Average price (all time)
- [x] Price history chart (by store, over time)

**History tab polish (v0.13.8):**
- [x] Price/unit column shows purchase QU price by default (e.g. £1.10/pack) — converted client-side from stored stock-unit price via `quantity_unit_conversions`
- [x] Toggle between per-purchase-unit and per-stock-unit views (pill segmented control; only shown when a conversion factor is defined)
- [x] Stat pills (Last price, Avg price) reflect the active price view
- [x] Price history chart repositioned below the purchase log table and wrapped in a collapsible `<details>` section
- [x] Chart Y-axis and tooltip update to match the toggle (purchase or stock unit)

**Consumption analytics (v0.13.2):**
- [x] Last used/consumed date
- [x] Average shelf life (calculated from history)
- [x] Spoil rate (% marked spoiled vs normal consume)

**Quick links from modal (v0.13.0):**
- [x] View stock entries (filtered)
- [x] View stock journal
- [x] Purchase this product
- [x] Edit product

**Reports pages:**
- [x] Waste report (spoiled items over time, by product group)
- [x] Spending report (by product group, by store, over time)
- [x] Stock value report (total inventory value)
- [x] Expiring soon report (printable)

**Bug fixes & data integrity (v0.13.9):**
- [x] Deleted stock entries no longer leave ghost records in the History tab price chart
- [x] Purchase transactions in the Stock Journal are now undoable (removes the stock entry + marks the log row undone)
- [x] Product Detail modal accessible from Master Data > Products List (click product name or image); zero-stock products fully supported

**Bug fixes & UX polish (v0.13.10):**
- [x] dnd-kit hydration mismatch warning resolved — stable `id` props added to all three `DndContext` instances in the Meal Plan page (`MealPlanWeekView`, `MealPlanClient`, `MealPlanSectionsManager`)
- [x] Missing React `key` prop warning resolved — `sections.map()` in `MealPlanWeekView` now uses `<React.Fragment key={section.id}>` instead of a keyless shorthand fragment
- [x] Recipe meal entries in the week grid and mobile day view are now clickable links to `/recipes/{id}`

**Test fix (v0.13.11):**
- [x] Stale `undoTransaction` test updated — probe value changed from `'purchase'` (now handled) to `'transfer-to'` (genuinely unhandled), restoring green CI

**Bug fix (v0.13.12):**
- [x] Recipe instructions markdown numbered lists now render correctly — `@tailwindcss/typography` installed and registered via `@plugin` in `globals.css`; Tailwind preflight was stripping `list-style` with no counter-rule since the plugin was missing

**Default location display (v0.13.14):**
- [x] Product detail modal hero now shows the product's default storage location
</details>

- [ ] Recipe suggestions from current stock
- [ ] Chalkboard component for AI suggestions
- [ ] User-provided API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- [ ] On-device mobile inference option
- [ ] Tool calling framework with Zod schema validation
- [ ] Unified AI provider abstraction (cloud / self-hosted / on-device)

**Other:**
- [ ] Multi-language support (i18n)
- [ ] Voice input for hands-free use

### Design Philosophy

> Inspired by [Grocy](https://grocy.info) — ported for modern cloud deployment.

1. **Cloud-first** — No Docker, no server management. Sign in and go.
2. **Progressive complexity** — Start simple, enable features as needed.
3. **Waste reduction focus** — Expiry tracking is core, not an afterthought.
4. **Cozy aesthetic** — Software you enjoy using, not just tolerate.

Already happy with Grocy/Mealie/Tandoor? Stick with them — they're battle-tested and feature-complete. Food Wars is for those who want something simpler to deploy.
